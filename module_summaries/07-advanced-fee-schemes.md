## Module 7: Advanced Fee & High-Yield Schemes

**Welcome to the seventh module of the Fraud Awareness Course by getclarity.finance!**

### Learning Objective

This module will teach you how to be skeptical of investment opportunities that require an upfront fee to unlock a larger promised return, a common tactic used by fraudsters.

### Key Topics Covered

*   **Understanding Advance Fee Fraud:** We will explore the psychology behind advance fee scams, where fraudsters convince their victims to pay a small amount of money with the promise of a much larger return that never materializes.
*   **High-Yield Investment Programs (HYIPs):** Learn about these fraudulent schemes that promise unsustainably high returns, often on a daily or weekly basis. We will discuss why such returns are almost always a sign of a scam.
*   **Recognizing the Red Flags:** This module will provide you with a checklist of red flags to look out for, such as pressure to act quickly, requests for payment via unconventional methods, and a lack of clear documentation.

### Indian Examples & Case Studies

To provide a real-world context for these scams, this module will discuss:

*   **Numerous online scams** that have been reported in India where users are asked to pay a "processing fee," "tax," or "conversion charge" to release a large (and non-existent) lottery winning, inheritance, or investment return.

At getclarity.finance, we believe that if an offer seems too good to be true, it probably is. This module will help you develop a healthy sense of skepticism to protect yourself from these types of fraud.
