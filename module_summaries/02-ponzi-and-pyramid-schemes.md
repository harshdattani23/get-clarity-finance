## Module 2: Ponzi & Pyramid Schemes

**Welcome to the second module of the Fraud Awareness Course by getclarity.finance!**

### Learning Objective

This module is designed to give you the skills to confidently differentiate between legitimate investment opportunities and fraudulent Ponzi or pyramid schemes. By the end of this module, you will understand the mechanics of these schemes and be able to spot their warning signs from a mile away.

### Key Topics Covered

*   **The Mechanics of a Ponzi Scheme:** We will dissect the structure of a Ponzi scheme, showing how they rely on a constant flow of new investors to pay returns to earlier ones, creating a dangerous illusion of profitability.
*   **Ponzi vs. Pyramid Schemes:** Learn the key differences between these two types of financial fraud. While both are unsustainable, they have distinct structures and reward systems.
*   **Red Flags and Warning Signs:** This module will equip you with a checklist of red flags to look out for, such as promises of guaranteed high returns, complex and secretive strategies, and a focus on recruiting new members.

### Indian Examples & Case Studies

To illustrate the real-world impact of these schemes, this module will examine some of the most notorious cases in India:

*   **The Saradha Group Chit Fund Scam:** A massive Ponzi scheme that collapsed in 2013, defrauding hundreds of thousands of investors, primarily in West Bengal and other eastern states. This case serves as a stark reminder of the devastating social and economic consequences of such schemes.
*   **The SpeakAsia Online Survey Scam:** A classic example of a pyramid scheme that promised high returns for simply filling out online surveys. The business model was primarily based on recruiting new members, and it eventually collapsed, leaving many in financial ruin.
