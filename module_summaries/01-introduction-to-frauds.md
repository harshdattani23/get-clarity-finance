## Module 1: Introduction to Stock Market Frauds

**Welcome to the first module of the Fraud Awareness Course by getclarity.finance!**

### Learning Objective

This foundational module is designed to provide you with a comprehensive understanding of the landscape of securities fraud in India. By the end of this module, you will be able to recognize the basic patterns of fraud, identify common red flags, and understand the serious impact these activities can have on your financial well-being.

### Key Topics Covered

*   **What is Securities Fraud?:** We'll start by defining what constitutes securities fraud and explore its consequences for both individual investors and the overall integrity of the financial markets.
*   **Common Channels for Fraud:** Learn about the modern channels that fraudsters use to target unsuspecting investors, with a special focus on social media platforms like WhatsApp and Telegram, as well as fake websites and investment apps.
*   **Overview of Major Fraud Types:** This module will introduce you to the most common types of fraud, including Ponzi schemes, pump-and-dump operations, and insider trading. We will lay the groundwork for a deeper dive into each of these topics in later modules.

### Indian Examples & Case Studies

To bring these concepts to life, this module will explore two of the most significant financial scams in Indian history:

*   **The Harshad Mehta Scam (1992):** A classic case of audacious market manipulation where bank funds were illegally siphoned to massively inflate stock prices. This case serves as a powerful example of how systemic loopholes can be exploited and the devastating impact it can have on the market.
*   **The Satyam Scam (2009):** A landmark case of corporate fraud where the founder of a major IT company admitted to falsifying company accounts to the tune of thousands of crores. This case highlights the critical importance of carefully scrutinizing a company's financial statements before investing.
