## Module 9: Broker-Related Fraud

**Welcome to the ninth and final module of the Fraud Awareness Course by getclarity.finance!**

### Learning Objective

This module will educate you on the potential for fraud to be committed by your own broker or their firm, and it will teach you how to protect yourself from these significant risks.

### Key Topics Covered

*   **Account Churning:** Learn about "churning," the illegal and unethical practice where a broker engages in excessive trading in a client's account primarily to generate commissions.
*   **Unauthorized Trading:** We will discuss the risks of brokers making trades in your account without your permission.
*   **Embezzlement:** Understand the signs of broker embezzlement, which is the outright theft of client funds.
*   **How to Protect Yourself:** This module will provide you with a set of practical steps you can take to protect yourself, such as regularly reviewing your account statements and trade confirmations, and knowing how to file a complaint with SEBI.

### Indian Examples & Case Studies

To underscore the importance of this topic, this module will examine:

*   **The Karvy Stock Broking Scandal:** A major case where a prominent brokerage firm illegally pledged client securities to raise loans for its own corporate purposes. This scandal highlighted the critical importance of investors regularly monitoring their own demat accounts and being aware of the securities they hold.

At getclarity.finance, we believe that trust and transparency are the cornerstones of a healthy investor-broker relationship. This module will empower you to be a more vigilant and proactive owner of your investment accounts.
