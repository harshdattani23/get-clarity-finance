## Module 4: Insider Trading & Market Manipulation

**Welcome to the fourth module of the Fraud Awareness Course by getclarity.finance!**

### Learning Objective

This module will provide you with a clear understanding of what constitutes illegal insider trading and other forms of market manipulation, helping you to recognize when market activity may not be what it seems.

### Key Topics Covered

*   **Defining Insider Trading:** We will define "material non-public information" (MNPI) and explain why it is illegal to trade on it. You will learn about who can be considered an "insider" and the legal and ethical implications of their actions.
*   **Other Forms of Market Manipulation:** This module will also cover other sophisticated manipulation techniques, such as:
    *   **Circular Trading:** Where a group of traders create artificial trading volume by buying and selling securities among themselves.
    *   **Front Running:** Where brokers use advance knowledge of large client orders to make personal gains.
*   **The Legal Consequences:** Understand the serious legal and financial penalties for engaging in insider trading and market manipulation in India.

### Indian Examples & Case Studies

To illustrate these complex concepts, this module will discuss:

*   **The Rakesh Jhunjhunwala Case (Aptech Insider Trading):** While he was ultimately cleared, this high-profile case brought the issue of insider trading among prominent investors to the forefront. It serves as an excellent example of how SEBI investigates such matters and the complexities involved in proving insider trading.
