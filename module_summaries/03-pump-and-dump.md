## Module 3: Pump & Dump Operations

**Welcome to the third module of the Fraud Awareness Course by getclarity.finance!**

### Learning Objective

This module will teach you how to identify and protect yourself from pump-and-dump schemes, a common form of market manipulation where stock prices are artificially inflated and then crashed, leaving unsuspecting investors with significant losses.

### Key Topics Covered

*   **The Two Phases of the Scheme:** We will break down the two distinct phases of a pump-and-dump operation:
    *   **The "Pump":** Learn how fraudsters use false and misleading positive statements, often spread through social media, online forums, and bulk SMS, to artificially inflate the price of a stock.
    *   **The "Dump":** Understand how the manipulators then sell off their shares at the inflated price, causing the stock to crash and leaving other investors with worthless shares.
*   **The Role of Social Media:** This module will place a special focus on how modern technology and social media platforms have made it easier for fraudsters to execute these schemes on a large scale.
*   **Identifying Penny Stock Scams:** Learn why pump-and-dump schemes often target penny stocks and how to be skeptical of unsolicited tips about small-cap companies.

### Indian Examples & Case Studies

To provide a practical understanding of this type of fraud, this module will explore:

*   **SEBI's Crackdown on Stock Tip Providers:** We will look at recent examples of how the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has taken action against individuals and groups using platforms like WhatsApp and Telegram to provide "guaranteed returns" on penny stocks, which are often part of pump-and-dump operations.
