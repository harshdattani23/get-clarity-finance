## Module 8: Spoofing & Wash Trading

**Welcome to the eighth module of the Fraud Awareness Course by getclarity.finance!**

### Learning Objective

This module will provide you with insight into some of the more complex market manipulation techniques used by sophisticated traders to create a false impression of market activity and lure in other investors.

### Key Topics Covered

*   **Spoofing Explained:** We will define "spoofing," which is the illegal practice of placing large orders to buy or sell a security with no intention of ever executing them. The goal is to create a false sense of demand or supply, thereby tricking other traders into making decisions that benefit the manipulator.
*   **Wash Trading Explained:** Learn about "wash trading," a practice where a single entity or a group of colluding traders trade with themselves to create artificial trading volume. This makes a stock appear more in-demand than it actually is.
*   **How to Spot These Activities:** While difficult for the average retail investor to detect, this module will discuss some of the signs that might indicate these manipulative practices are occurring.

### Indian Examples & Case Studies

To highlight the relevance of these advanced topics, this module will refer to:

*   **SEBI's increased use of advanced analytics and surveillance tools** to detect and penalize entities that engage in spoofing, wash trading, and other forms of algorithmic manipulation. This demonstrates the regulator's commitment to curbing these sophisticated forms of fraud.
