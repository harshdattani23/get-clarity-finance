      "title": "The Mechanics of a Ponzi Scheme",
      "p1": "A Ponzi scheme is a fraudulent investing scam promising high rates of return with little risk to investors. It generates returns for earlier investors with money taken from later investors. This is similar to a pyramid scheme in that both are based on using new investors' funds to pay the earlier backers.",
      "p2": "The scheme is named after Charles Ponzi, who became notorious for using the technique in 1920. The scheme is designed to collapse, and it inevitably does when the flood of new money dries up.",
      "p3": "Key characteristics of a Ponzi scheme include:",
      "list": [
        "A promise of high returns with little or no risk.",
        "A consistent flow of returns regardless of market conditions.",
        "An investment strategy that is secret or described as too complex to explain.",
        "A focus on attracting new investors to keep the scheme going."
