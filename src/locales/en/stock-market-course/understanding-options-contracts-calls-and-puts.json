    "description": "Unlock the power of options. This lesson demystifies call and put options, explaining how they work and their fundamental role in both speculation and hedging strategies.",
    "introduction": "Options are one of the most versatile and powerful tools in the financial markets. Unlike stocks, where you simply buy or sell ownership, options are contracts that give the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an underlying asset at a predetermined price within a specific timeframe. This unique feature opens up a world of strategic possibilities. Let's break down the two fundamental types of options: Calls and Puts.",
    "section1_title": "What is an Option?",
    "section1_p1": "An option is a contract that derives its value from an underlying asset, like a stock. The contract offers the buyer the opportunity to buy or sell the asset at an agreed-upon price. Key terms to know are:",
    "section1_l1": "<strong>Strike Price:</strong> The price at which the underlying asset can be bought or sold.",
    "section1_l2": "<strong>Expiration Date:</strong> The date after which the option is no longer valid.",
    "section1_l3": "<strong>Premium:</strong> The price you pay to buy the option contract.",
    "section1_l4": "<strong>Underlying Asset:</strong> The stock, commodity, or other financial instrument that the option is based on.",
    "section2_title": "The Two Types of Options: Calls and Puts",
    "section2.1_title": "Call Options: The Right to Buy",
    "section2.1_p1": "A <strong>Call Option</strong> gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, to <strong>buy</strong> an asset at the strike price on or before the expiration date. You buy a call option when you are <strong>bullish</strong> on the underlying asset, meaning you expect its price to rise. If the price goes up, you can exercise your option to buy the asset at the lower strike price and then sell it at the higher market price for a profit.",
    "section2.2_title": "Put Options: The Right to Sell",
    "section2.2_p1": "A <strong>Put Option</strong> gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, to <strong>sell</strong> an asset at the strike price on or before the expiration date. You buy a put option when you are <strong>bearish</strong> on the underlying asset, meaning you expect its price to fall. If the price goes down, you can buy the asset at the lower market price and then exercise your option to sell it at the higher strike price for a profit.",
    "section3_title": "A Simple Analogy: A Real Estate Deal",
    "section3_p1": "Imagine you find a piece of land you want to buy for ₹10 Lakhs, but you need 3 months to secure financing. You pay the seller ₹50,000 to have the exclusive right to buy the land for ₹10 Lakhs within those 3 months. This ₹50,000 is the 'premium'. You now hold an 'option'.",
    "section3_p2": "If a developer announces a new project nearby and the land's value shoots up to ₹15 Lakhs, you can exercise your option, buy it for ₹10 Lakhs, and immediately have a valuable asset. If the value drops to ₹8 Lakhs, you can let the option expire, and your only loss is the ₹50,000 premium. This is how a call option works.",
    "conclusion_title": "Conclusion: A Tool for Strategy and Flexibility",
    "conclusion_p1": "Options are not just for speculation; they are powerful tools for hedging and managing risk. By understanding the fundamental difference between calls (betting on a price increase) and puts (betting on a price decrease), you can begin to explore more advanced strategies to enhance your portfolio and protect your investments."
