    "title": "Understanding Futures Contracts",
    "description": "Dive into the world of futures contracts. This lesson explains what they are, how they work, and how they differ from options, providing a clear understanding of this essential derivative.",
    "introduction": "Futures contracts are a cornerstone of the derivatives market, widely used by producers, consumers, and speculators. Unlike options, which give you a choice, a futures contract is an obligation. It's a standardized legal agreement to buy or sell a particular commodity or financial instrument at a predetermined price at a specified time in the future. Let's explore how these contracts work.",
    "section1_title": "What is a Futures Contract?",
    "section1_p1": "A futures contract is a legally binding agreement to buy or sell a standardized asset at a future date at a price agreed upon today. Key characteristics include:",
    "section1_l1": "<strong>Standardization:</strong> Futures contracts are standardized in terms of quantity, quality, and delivery date, which allows them to be traded on an exchange.",
    "section1_l2": "<strong>Obligation:</strong> Unlike options, both the buyer and the seller are obligated to fulfill the contract at expiration. The buyer must buy, and the seller must sell.",
    "section1_l3": "<strong>Exchange Traded:</strong> Futures are traded on organized exchanges, which provides liquidity and reduces counterparty risk.",
    "section1_l4": "<strong>Marked-to-Market:</strong> Gains and losses on futures contracts are settled daily, a process known as 'marking to market'.",
    "section2_title": "How Do Futures Work? A Simple Example",
    "section2_p1": "Imagine a farmer who will harvest 1,000 bushels of wheat in three months. The current price of wheat is ₹20 per bushel, but the farmer is worried the price might fall. To lock in the current price, she sells a futures contract to deliver 1,000 bushels of wheat in three months at ₹20 per bushel. A bread maker, who needs wheat and is worried the price might rise, buys the contract. In three months, regardless of the market price of wheat, the farmer is obligated to sell her wheat for ₹20 per bushel, and the bread maker is obligated to buy it at that price. This is how futures are used for hedging.",
    "section3_title": "Futures vs. Options: The Key Difference",
    "section3_p1": "The most critical distinction between futures and options lies in the obligation. A futures contract is an <strong>obligation</strong> to transact, while an option is the <strong>right</strong>, but not the obligation, to transact. With an option, your maximum loss is the premium you paid. With a futures contract, because you are obligated to buy or sell, your potential losses can be substantial if the market moves against you.",
    "conclusion_title": "Conclusion: A Tool for Certainty in an Uncertain World",
    "conclusion_p1": "Futures contracts are a vital tool for managing price risk in a wide variety of markets, from agriculture to finance. By locking in a future price, they provide certainty for businesses and an opportunity for speculators. However, their obligatory nature and the potential for large losses mean they should be approached with a thorough understanding and a clear strategy."
