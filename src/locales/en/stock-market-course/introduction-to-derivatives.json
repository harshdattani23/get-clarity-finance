        "title": "What is a Derivative?",
        "p1": "A derivative is a financial contract between two or more parties whose value is based on an agreed-upon underlying financial asset (like a stock or a bond) or a set of assets (like an index). The derivative itself is a contract, and its value is 'derived' from the fluctuations in the price of the underlying asset.",
        "p2": "Think of it like a bet on the future price of something. You're not buying the asset itself, but a contract that pays out based on the asset's price change."
