    "title": "Using Essential Technical Indicators (Moving Averages, RSI, MACD)",
    "description": "Go beyond basic charts. This lesson will equip you with three of the most powerful and widely-used technical indicators: Moving Averages, the Relative Strength Index (RSI), and the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD).",
    "intro": "While price charts and trends give you the lay of the land, technical indicators are like your GPS, providing specific signals about market momentum, potential reversals, and trend strength. They are mathematical calculations based on a stock's price, volume, or open interest. Let's explore three of the most essential indicators every trader should know.",
    "image_placeholder_1": "An image showing a stock chart with all three indicators (Moving Averages, RSI, and MACD) plotted on it, giving a comprehensive view.",
    "movingAverages": {
        "title": "1. Moving Averages (MA): Smoothing the Path",
        "p1": "A Moving Average is one of the most basic but powerful technical indicators. It smooths out price data by creating a constantly updated average price. This helps to reduce 'noise' and highlight the underlying trend direction. Think of it as drawing a cleaner, more readable line through the chaotic zigzags of daily price movements.",
        "sma": {
            "title": "Simple Moving Average (SMA)",
            "p1": "The SMA is the most straightforward type of MA. It's calculated by adding up the closing prices for a specific number of periods (e.g., 50 days) and then dividing by that number of periods. For example, a 50-day SMA shows the average price over the last 50 trading days, with each day's price having equal weight.",
            "usage": "<strong>Usage:</strong> SMAs are excellent for identifying long-term trends. A 'Golden Cross' (50-day SMA crosses above 200-day SMA) is a classic long-term bullish signal, while a 'Death Cross' (50-day SMA crosses below 200-day SMA) is bearish."
        },
        "ema": {
            "title": "Exponential Moving Average (EMA)",
            "p1": "The EMA gives more weight to the most recent prices, making it more responsive to new information and sudden price changes. This sensitivity makes it a favorite for many short-term traders who need to react quickly.",
            "usage": "<strong>Usage:</strong> EMAs are ideal for identifying short-term trend changes and generating trading signals. A common strategy is to look for 'crossovers,' where a shorter-term EMA (e.g., 12-day) crosses above a longer-term EMA (e.g., 26-day) to signal a buy, and vice-versa for a sell."

        "animation_placeholder_1": "Animation showing the difference in responsiveness between an SMA and an EMA as new price data is added. The EMA line will hug the price action more closely than the slower-moving SMA line."
    },
    "rsi": {
        "title": "2. Relative Strength Index (RSI): The Momentum Gauge",
        "p1": "The RSI is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and magnitude of price changes. It oscillates between 0 and 100, acting like a tachometer for the market, showing how fast prices are rising or falling.",
        "howItWorks": "<strong>How it Works:</strong> The RSI, typically calculated over 14 periods, helps traders identify overbought or oversold conditions. It compares the average gain on up-days to the average loss on down-days.",
        "overbought": "<strong>Overbought (RSI > 70):</strong> When the RSI rises above 70, it suggests that a stock has been bought heavily and may be overvalued. This is a warning sign that the upward momentum might be fading, and a price correction could be imminent.",
        "oversold": "<strong>Oversold (RSI < 30):</strong> When the RSI falls below 30, it indicates that a stock has been sold heavily and may be undervalued. This could be a signal that selling pressure is exhausted and a price bounce is likely.",
        "divergence": "<strong>Divergence:</strong> A powerful signal occurs when the price makes a new high, but the RSI fails to make a new high (bearish divergence), or when the price makes a new low, but the RSI makes a higher low (bullish divergence). This often precedes a trend reversal.",
        "animation_placeholder_2": "Animation showing the RSI line moving up into the overbought zone (>70) as a stock price rises sharply, and then falling into the oversold zone (<30) as the price drops. It could also illustrate a bullish divergence."
    },
    "macd": {
        "title": "3. Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD): The Trend-Follower",
        "p1": "The MACD is a versatile trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs). It's designed to reveal changes in the strength, direction, momentum, and duration of a trend.",
        "macdLine": "<strong>The MACD Line:</strong> Calculated by subtracting the 26-period EMA from the 12-period EMA. This is the 'fast' line.",
        "signalLine": "<strong>The Signal Line:</strong> A 9-period EMA of the MACD Line. This is the 'slow' line that acts as a trigger for signals.",
        "histogram": "<strong>The Histogram:</strong> The MACD Line minus the Signal Line. It visually represents the distance between the two lines. When the histogram is positive and growing, bullish momentum is increasing. When it's negative and growing, bearish momentum is increasing.",
        "signals": {
            "title": "How to Read MACD Signals",
            "bullish": "<strong>Bullish Crossover:</strong> When the MACD Line (fast line) crosses above the Signal Line (slow line), it's a buy signal, suggesting that momentum is shifting to the upside.",
            "bearish": "<strong>Bearish Crossover:</strong> When the MACD Line crosses below the Signal Line, it's a sell signal, indicating that momentum is shifting to the downside."
        },

        "takeaway2": "The <strong>RSI</strong> is your momentum gauge, warning you of overbought (>70) and oversold (<30) conditions, and potential trend reversals through divergence.",
        "takeaway3": "The <strong>MACD</strong> is a dynamic indicator that provides clear buy and sell signals through crossovers, helping you follow the trend's momentum.",
        "takeaway4": "These indicators are tools, not crystal balls. Their real power is unlocked when used in <strong>combination</strong> to confirm signals, rather than in isolation."
