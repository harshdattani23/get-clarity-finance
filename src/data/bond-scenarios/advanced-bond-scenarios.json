    "detailedScenario": "Dr. Sarah Kapoor, a portfolio manager at a pension fund, holds 5% of her portfolio in ABC Manufacturing's AAA-rated bonds yielding 7.8%. ABC announces a $2 billion acquisition funded entirely through debt, which will increase their debt-to-equity ratio from 0.25 to 0.85. Rating agencies place the bonds on review for possible downgrade. The bonds currently trade at ‚Çπ1,020 per ‚Çπ1,000 face value. ABC's management presents compelling strategic rationale for the acquisition, claiming it will double their market share and create significant synergies. However, the acquisition target operates in a cyclical industry with volatile cash flows. The transaction is expected to close in 6 months, and credit rating decision is expected within 3 months. Sarah must decide whether to hold, sell, or increase exposure based on her professional analysis.",

Economic indicators suggest the central bank may continue raising rates for 6-12 months to combat inflation, but recession risk is increasing. Ravi's fund mandate allows duration between 4-10 years and permits up to 20% allocation to floating rate securities.
