    "detailedScenario": "Meet Suresh, a 45-year-old businessman from Mumbai. He receives a call from someone claiming to be from 'National Bond Advisory Services.' The caller, Rakesh, says they are offering exclusive 'government-guaranteed bonds' with 12% annual returns, much higher than current bank fixed deposits. Rakesh claims these bonds are issued by the Government of India but are only available through their firm due to a 'special arrangement with RBI.' He provides a professional-looking website and asks Suresh to transfer ‚Çπ10 lakhs immediately via cryptocurrency payment to 'secure the allocation before rates drop.' Rakesh mentions that 'senior government officials and ministers are also investing' and creates urgency by saying only 24 hours remain. When Suresh asks why payment must be in cryptocurrency for a government bond, Rakesh claims it's for 'faster processing and tax advantages.'",
