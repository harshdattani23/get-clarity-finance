    "detailedScenario": "Meet Raj, a successful software engineer living in Bangalore. He's been approached by his friend Vikram who claims to have discovered an 'amazing investment opportunity.' Vikram shows him glossy brochures and testimonials from supposedly satisfied investors. The company, 'Golden Future Investments,' promises 20% monthly returns through their 'proprietary trading algorithm.' They claim to have partnerships with major international banks and use AI-powered trading strategies. Vikram mentions that the company is exclusive - they only accept investors who are referred by existing clients. He also mentions that if Raj refers 3 more people, he'll get a special 5% bonus on his returns. The company requires a minimum investment of ‚Çπ2 lakh and asks for immediate payment via cash or cryptocurrency to 'secure the limited spots.' They provide no detailed documentation about their trading strategies, citing 'competitive secrecy.'",

    "detailedScenario": "Priya, a bank manager from Mumbai, is attending a financial seminar in a 5-star hotel. The presenter, Dr. Sharma, claims to be a former RBI advisor (though this can't be verified). He's presenting 'Wealth Multiplier Pro,' an investment scheme that has allegedly generated 30% annual returns for the past 3 years. Dr. Sharma shows impressive charts and graphs, testimonials from 'satisfied clients,' and mentions partnerships with European hedge funds. However, when attendees ask about the specific investment strategy, he becomes evasive, saying it's 'highly technical' and involves 'proprietary arbitrage methods' that he cannot disclose due to competitive reasons. He mentions that the strategy exploits 'market inefficiencies' and uses 'algorithmic trading systems.' The scheme requires investors to sign an NDA before investing, and they discourage any independent research. Dr. Sharma pressures the audience by saying only the first 50 investors will get the 'founder's rate' and slots are filling up quickly.",
