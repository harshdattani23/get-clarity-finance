The group has over 300 members and is managed by someone calling himself 'Stock Guru Rajesh.' Every day, Rajesh shares screenshots of his trading profits showing gains of 15-20% daily. He claims to use 'insider information' and 'AI algorithms' to predict market movements. The group members constantly praise Rajesh, sharing their own profit screenshots. Rajesh announces a 'VIP membership' for ‚Çπ25,000 that gives access to his 'premium calls' with guaranteed 30% monthly returns. He creates urgency by saying only 20 VIP spots are available and shows a countdown timer. Several group members immediately pay and share screenshots of their payments, encouraging others to join quickly.",
