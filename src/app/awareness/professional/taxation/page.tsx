        <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">The GST Revolution</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          The Goods and Services Tax (GST), introduced in 2017, was India&apos;s most significant tax reform. It replaced a confusing web of over a dozen central and state taxes with a single, unified tax structure. The goal was to create a common market, reduce cascading taxes, and improve compliance.

                <strong>Key Concept:</strong> GST is a destination-based, multi-stage, consumption tax. In simple terms, tax is collected at each stage of the supply chain, and the end consumer bears the final cost.

          However, the reality is more complex than the &apos;One Nation, One Tax&apos; slogan suggests. There are multiple tax slabs (0%, 5%, 12%, 18%, 28%), plus special rates for items like gold. Compliance can be a heavy burden, requiring monthly, quarterly, and annual filings.

        <p className="mb-4">
          Beyond GST, businesses must navigate several other key taxes.

              <p className="text-gray-600">The standard corporate tax rate has been progressively reduced to make India more competitive. For new manufacturing companies, the rate can be as low as 15% (plus cess and surcharge), while most domestic companies fall into a 22% or 30% slab, depending on various factors. Understanding these nuances is key for financial planning.</p>

              <h3 className="font-bold text-lg text-gray-800">Capital Gains Tax</h3>
              <p className="text-gray-600">This is crucial for investors. Gains from selling assets are taxed. The rate depends on the asset type (e.g., equity shares, property) and the holding period. Short-term gains are generally taxed at higher rates than long-term gains.</p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          A significant point of concern for startups and foreign investors has been the &quot;Angel Tax&quot;. This is a tax levied on the premium paid by investors for shares in a private company, where the share price is seen as exceeding the &quot;fair market value&quot;.

                While intended to prevent money laundering, this tax has often been a bottleneck for legitimate startup funding. The government has introduced several exemptions and clarifications over the years, but it remains a complex and often unpredictable area of tax law.
