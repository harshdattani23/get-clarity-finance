## 🎯 Solving TWO Critical SEBI Problem Statements

This project is our comprehensive solution for the **[GFF 2025 SEBI Hackathon](https://www.globalfintechfest.com/sebi-hackathon)**, uniquely addressing **BOTH** major problem statements:

### 🚨 **Problem Statement 1: Fraud Prevention**

**The Crisis:** Fraudsters exploit retail investors through:
- Fake advisors impersonating legitimate Investment Advisors/Research Analysts/Brokers
- Ponzi schemes promising unrealistic high returns
- Social media manipulation and misleading investment advice

### 📚 **Problem Statement 2: Enhancing Retail Investor Education and Engagement**

**The Challenge:** India's rapidly growing retail investor base faces:
- Lack of comprehensive financial literacy
- Limited access to quality education in vernacular languages
- Insufficient practical experience before real money investment
- Poor engagement with traditional educational resources

## Market Data and Virtual Trading

- Virtual trading reads prices, changes, and volumes from the database via the API route `POST /api/stock-data`.
- The indices banner (NIFTY 50, SENSEX 30, BANK NIFTY, FINNIFTY) and the scrolling ticker also pull from the database.
- The UI is a simulated environment. Prices reflect the previous trading day’s close and are for illustration only. Orders and P&L are simulated. Nothing here is investment advice.

### Updating Prices into the Database

Use the Python updater in `python/update_prices.py` to fetch closing data and write to Cloud SQL.

Prereqs:
- Cloud SQL Proxy running locally (connects to your instance and exposes 127.0.0.1:5432)
- `DATABASE_URL` set for the app (same connection string used by Next.js)

Example (PowerShell):
```powershell
# Start Cloud SQL Proxy separately (example; adjust to your instance)
# .\cloud-sql-proxy.exe <INSTANCE_CONNECTION_NAME>=tcp:5432

# Set DB URL for this shell
$env:DATABASE_URL="postgresql://<user>:<pass>@127.0.0.1:5432/<database>"

# Run the updater
cd python
python update_prices.py
```

Notes:
- The updater fetches via Groww and writes to `Stock` (price, change, percentChange, volume, lastUpdatedAt).
- It detects index tickers and uses the appropriate exchange (e.g., `SENSEX` via BSE; `NIFTY`/`BANKNIFTY`/`FINNIFTY` via NSE) and retries across exchanges for symbols when needed.
- Market cap is not populated by the current API (returns `null`); volume and price are.

### Ensure Index Rows Exist

Create these rows once if they are missing, so banners can display values from DB:
```sql
INSERT INTO "Stock"(ticker, name, industry, "marketCap", indices)
VALUES
 ('NIFTY','NIFTY 50','Index','0',ARRAY['Index']),
 ('SENSEX','SENSEX 30','Index','0',ARRAY['Index']),
 ('BANKNIFTY','BANK NIFTY','Index','0',ARRAY['Index']),
 ('FINNIFTY','FINNIFTY','Index','0',ARRAY['Index'])
ON CONFLICT (ticker) DO NOTHING;
```

### API: Fetching Stock Data

- Endpoint: `POST /api/stock-data`
- Body: `{ "tickers": ["RELIANCE", "TCS"] }`
- Response: `[{ ticker, price, change, percentChange, volume, lastUpdatedAt }]`

The frontend uses a small hook to call this endpoint and render values without any real-time subscriptions.
