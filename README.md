### The Problem: Enhancing Retail Investor Education and Engagement

This project is an entry for the **[GFF 2025 SEBI Hackathon](https://www.globalfintechfest.com/sebi-hackathon)**, targeting the "Enhancing Retail Investor Education and Engagement" problem statement.

The Indian securities market is growing at an unprecedented rate, but this growth comes with significant risks. Millions of new retail investors are entering the market, but many lack the financial literacy to navigate it safely. This knowledge gap is exploited by fraudsters who use sophisticated tactics on social media and messaging apps to promote scams, spread misinformation, and manipulate stock prices. Furthermore, most educational resources are in English, leaving a large gap in vernacular languages. The result is significant financial loss for everyday investors and an erosion of trust in the market.

## Market Data and Virtual Trading

- Virtual trading reads prices, changes, and volumes from the database via the API route `POST /api/stock-data`.
- The indices banner (NIFTY 50, SENSEX 30, BANK NIFTY, FINNIFTY) and the scrolling ticker also pull from the database.
- The UI is a simulated environment. Prices reflect the previous trading day‚Äôs close and are for illustration only. Orders and P&L are simulated. Nothing here is investment advice.

### Updating Prices into the Database

Use the Python updater in `python/update_prices.py` to fetch closing data and write to Cloud SQL.

Prereqs:
- Cloud SQL Proxy running locally (connects to your instance and exposes 127.0.0.1:5432)
- `DATABASE_URL` set for the app (same connection string used by Next.js)

Example (PowerShell):
```powershell
# Start Cloud SQL Proxy separately (example; adjust to your instance)
# .\cloud-sql-proxy.exe <INSTANCE_CONNECTION_NAME>=tcp:5432

# Set DB URL for this shell
$env:DATABASE_URL="postgresql://<user>:<pass>@127.0.0.1:5432/<database>"

# Run the updater
cd python
python update_prices.py
```

Notes:
- The updater fetches via Groww and writes to `Stock` (price, change, percentChange, volume, lastUpdatedAt).
- It detects index tickers and uses the appropriate exchange (e.g., `SENSEX` via BSE; `NIFTY`/`BANKNIFTY`/`FINNIFTY` via NSE) and retries across exchanges for symbols when needed.
- Market cap is not populated by the current API (returns `null`); volume and price are.

### Ensure Index Rows Exist

Create these rows once if they are missing, so banners can display values from DB:
```sql
INSERT INTO "Stock"(ticker, name, industry, "marketCap", indices)
VALUES
 ('NIFTY','NIFTY 50','Index','0',ARRAY['Index']),
 ('SENSEX','SENSEX 30','Index','0',ARRAY['Index']),
 ('BANKNIFTY','BANK NIFTY','Index','0',ARRAY['Index']),
 ('FINNIFTY','FINNIFTY','Index','0',ARRAY['Index'])
ON CONFLICT (ticker) DO NOTHING;
```

### API: Fetching Stock Data

- Endpoint: `POST /api/stock-data`
- Body: `{ "tickers": ["RELIANCE", "TCS"] }`
- Response: `[{ ticker, price, change, percentChange, volume, lastUpdatedAt }]`

The frontend uses a small hook to call this endpoint and render values without any real-time subscriptions.
