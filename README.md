### The Problem: A Minefield for Retail Investors

The Indian securities market is growing at an unprecedented rate, but this growth comes with significant risks. Millions of new retail investors are entering the market, but many lack the financial literacy to navigate it safely. This knowledge gap is exploited by fraudsters who use sophisticated tactics on social media and messaging apps to promote scams, spread misinformation, and manipulate stock prices. The result is significant financial loss for everyday investors and an erosion of trust in the market.
