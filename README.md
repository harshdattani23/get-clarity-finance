This project is a submission for the **Securities Market Hackathon**, powered by BSE, CDSL, KFINTECH, NSDL and SEBI.

> Fraudsters employ a range of deceptive tactics to exploit or mislead investors... These activities cause financial losses to retail investors, erode their trust in the securities market and undermine market integrity.

## Our Solution

**Get Clarity Finance** is an AI-powered platform designed to directly address the "Fraud Prevention" challenge. We provide a tool that helps investors protect themselves by scanning online content, verifying advisor credentials, and flagging high-risk promotions before they can cause harm.

## üöÄ Key Features & Hackathon Outcomes

Our features are designed to meet the specific outcomes desired by the hackathon's "Fraud Prevention" problem statement:

- **üîç AI Content Analyzer**: Fulfills the need for a tool that "**scans online platforms, identifies suspicious investment offers / videos / audios / documents**". Users can paste any suspicious financial news, article, or social media post, and our AI will analyze it for signs of fraud, bias, or manipulation.

- **‚úÖ Entity Verification**: Addresses the need to "**verify advisor credentials against a regulatory database**". Our system allows users to quickly check if a stockbroker or investment advisor is a registered entity, helping to identify fraudulent advisors and impersonators.

- **üìä Trending Threats Dashboard**: Our platform is built to identify and link suspicious stock tips to market activity, fulfilling the need for a "**solution that monitors social media platforms...and provides a dashboard for regulators or exchanges to take action.**"

- **üìö Integrated Investor Education**: Aligned with SEBI‚Äôs mandate for investor protection, we provide a structured curriculum to build financial literacy and help users recognize and avoid common types of fraud.
