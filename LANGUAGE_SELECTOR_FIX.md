# Language Selector Fix - Market Fundamentals Page

## Issue
The language selection was not visible in the fundamental course page.

## Root Cause
The page was using a custom inline language selector implementation instead of the reusable `LanguageSelector` component that's used throughout the rest of the application.

## Solution Implemented

### Changes Made to `/src/app/stock-market-course/market-fundamentals/page.tsx`:

1. **Added Import Statement**
   - Imported the reusable `LanguageSelector` component from `@/components/stock-market-course/LanguageSelector`

2. **Removed Custom Implementation**
   - Removed the custom `SUPPORTED_LANGUAGES` array
   - Removed the dropdown implementation from the top bar
   - Removed the `showLanguageDropdown` state variable (no longer needed)

3. **Added Language Selector Component**
   - Placed the `LanguageSelector` component prominently at the top of the content area
   - The selector is now visible immediately when the page loads
   - Positioned before the section header for better visibility

4. **Added Language Change Handler**
   - Created `handleLanguageChange` function to handle language selection
   - Currently logs the selection to console
   - Ready for integration with translation logic

## Visual Improvements

The language selector now features:
- **Better Visibility**: Displayed prominently at the top of the content area
- **Consistent Design**: Uses the same component as other course pages
- **Grid Layout**: Languages displayed in a responsive 2-column (mobile) or 3-column (desktop) grid
- **Clear Visual Feedback**: Selected language highlighted in blue
- **Native Language Names**: Shows languages in their native scripts for better recognition

## Available Languages
- English
- हिंदी (Hindi)
- বাংলা (Bengali)  
- मराठी (Marathi)
- தமிழ் (Tamil)
- ગુજરાતી (Gujarati)

## How to Test

1. Navigate to the Market Fundamentals page at `/stock-market-course/market-fundamentals`
2. The language selector should be visible at the top of the content area
3. Click on any language button to select it
4. The selected language will be highlighted in blue
5. Check the browser console to see the language selection being logged

## Next Steps

To fully implement multilingual support:
1. Connect the language selector to your translation system
2. Load content based on the selected language
3. Store language preference in local storage or user settings
4. Update audio files to match the selected language
